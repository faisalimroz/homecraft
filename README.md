Challenges

During the development process, several challenges were encountered and addressed:

Day-wise Slot Creation & Deletion: Implementing a system where providers can create, manage, and delete service slots based on available days was a complex task. This required efficient handling of availability in the database and ensuring flexibility for providers to update schedules on the go.

Combo Pack Service Database Design: Structuring the database to handle combo services (where multiple services are bundled together) proved challenging, as it required creating relationships between individual services, ensuring accurate pricing, and seamless management in the provider dashboard.

Service Creation & Update: Developing the functionality for providers to create and update services involved managing complex forms, validation, and ensuring real-time updates without disrupting the user experience.

Service Details Page - Photo Gallery Design: Designing a user-friendly, responsive photo gallery on service detail pages was tricky, as it required balancing aesthetics with performance, especially when handling multiple images.

Testimonial Slider Design: Creating an interactive, visually appealing testimonial slider while keeping it fully responsive across all device sizes took several iterations to get right, especially with animation and layout synchronization.

On Offer Services Display: Effectively displaying "On Offer" services required implementing dynamic discount calculations and real-time updates, especially when providers could modify offers frequently.

Provider Dashboard - Statistics Section: One of the most challenging aspects was showing real-time statistics, including the last 7 daysâ€™ earnings on the provider dashboard. This involved creating a robust backend API to fetch and process booking and payment data in real-time.

Multiple Image Upload: Allowing providers to upload multiple images for their services while ensuring smooth uploads, validations, and preview functionality required both front-end and back-end optimization.

Service Rating Filter on Backend API: Implementing a backend API that could efficiently filter services based on ratings was tricky, as it required the creation of indexes and optimized queries to ensure fast performance even with large datasets.

Future Improvements
Enhance Provider Statistics: Improve the dashboard to show detailed, customizable statistics such as month-wise and year-wise earnings.
User Notifications: Implement push notifications for users to get real-time updates on booking statuses and promotions.
AI-based Service Recommendations: Incorporate machine learning models to recommend services to users based on their previous bookings and preferences.
